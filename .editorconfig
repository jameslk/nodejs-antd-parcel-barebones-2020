# EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the
# same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format
# for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read
# the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they
# work nicely with version control systems.
# Visit editorconfig.org for more information.
